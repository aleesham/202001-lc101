# Questions???

---

### Discussion Outline
- Definitions
- Design and MVP
- User Stories
- Code

---

### Definitions - some we know
- TDD: test driven development
- UML Diagram: unified modeling language diagram 

---

### Definitions - some we don't know
- agile development (versus waterfall) 
- minimum viable product
- user stories

Note that you can do tons and tons of research on this stuff, but you really only get good at it by doing. No surprise there.

---

### Waterfall versus Agile
<br/>

Waterfall: a project management approach where a project is completed in distinct stages and moved step by step toward ultimate release to consumers. You make a big plan upfront and then execute in a linear fashion, hoping there won't be any changes in the plan.

<br/>
<br/>
Agile: software development methodologies centered round the idea of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. Kanban and Scrum are the most popular flavors of agile. 

---

### MVP and User Stories

MVP: A Minimum Viable Product is the smallest thing you can build that delivers customer value.

<br/> 

User Stories: User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template: 

&emsp;&emsp; As a `<some user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>`.

<br/> 
Backlog: list of user stories; I have used RedMine, Jira, GitLab, and Trello

---

### Design and MVP

- How do we decide the design and MVP of the product? 
- Project managers and scrum master meet to discuss some of this.
- In my experience: the developers get a hand in design and defining MVP, but it depends on where you work

---

### Design and MVP

We already did design! Note that this IS NOT set in stone! In fact, we are going to use a more general design. But what does MVP look like?

</div>

---

### Design and MVP

One example of MVP could be that: MVP should consist of a runnable, gradable multiple choice test. With that in mind, let's write some stories!

<div>
    <img class="resize" alt="Multiple Choice Quiz" src="../../images/multiple-choice.jpg" />
</div>

### User stories

Recall the template: 
<br/> 
&emsp; "As a `<some user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>`."
<br/> 
<br/> 

Note that we don't HAVE to stick to a template, it depends on where you work and your team. I generally stick to a template when I have new developers on my team. 
<br/> 
<br/> 

In our case, we have two types of users. People writing the quiz and people taking the quiz.
<br/> 
<br/> 

Here is our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ZS2fBIJY/funwithquizzes). Let's add some more stories.

### Let's add the necessary stories to Todo for MVP

---

### How to Code a Story?

- Stories are not spelled out to us as TODOs like we have in our assignments.
- Suggestion: write out (in comments) what my line of attack will be. 
- Use TDD to guide you
- You get better by doing
